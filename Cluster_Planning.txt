cluster planning
capacity planning:
-----------------

Nodes: multiple disks
       within nodes : ES/LS/Beats: multiple paths...

avg no documents /day/index
avg size of index
count of shards--that are increasing/day/week/month
cpu usage[memory usage/disk usage] /

ram/node=-20% overhead
no of queries/appls--running (avg count)

disk = -20% overhead
consider: processes/logs/tmp files----disk usage
=================

update/insert operations ---->
compression ---->
node : failures/node being unavailable---->

data growth pattern
data access pattern
data recycle/retain policy..

10 nodes(data)
3 nodes(master)

16 week.........................>>disk exhausted
auto scaling ur cluster in 13 week...
