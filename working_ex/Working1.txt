#we can install and use kibana plugins such as 'sense' to work with our ES cluster or
#we can use 'KIBANA>DEV TOOLS"
#Open browser and access kibana "localhost:5601" [assuming elasticsearch and kibana services are running]

#Searching/Listing Index
1.
#Using '_cat' API we can retrieve information from cluster in human friendly format

GET /_cat/indices?v

#Result on right shows various information about our cluster such as number of private shards, replicas,
#shards, documents, deleted documents etc..
#By default ES created one replica for indexes and since we have one node, that one replica can't be alloca#allocated for high availability.Once a new node is added and replica is allocated to another node,the
#health status will turn to green.
#Note** we dont need to add index before adding a document to it.By adding a document, ES creates index
#with default settings automatically.
