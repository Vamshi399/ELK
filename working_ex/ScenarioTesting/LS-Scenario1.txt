Currently we have totally 4 nodes
3 nodes are master eligible and also action as data nodes
1 node is not master eligible but just acting as data node.

Which means at any point of time we can have max 1 copy as primary & 3 copies(as replicas) (on avai 4 data nodes)
Our index was created with default 5 primary shards, 1 replica shards
(which means data of index is divided into 5 shards and each shard has 1 replica)

#The distribution of primary and replica shards is as follows:
get /_cat/shards/population?pretty=true

#overall health for this index
get /_cluster/health/population?level=shards

#looking at more specific information
get /_cat/shards/population?h=index,shard,prirep,dc,state,node

pulation 3 r 104 STARTED data3
population 3 p 104 STARTED data2
population 4 p 100 STARTED master
population 4 r 100 STARTED data3
population 1 p  89 STARTED data3
population 1 r  89 STARTED data2
population 2 r  87 STARTED master
population 2 p  87 STARTED data1
population 0 p  86 STARTED master
population 0 r  86 STARTED data1


#Let's consider one of the nodes (data3) and what it contains
Before node-data3 shutdown
data3
shard 4 replica
shard 1 primary

master
shard 4 primary

data2
shard 1 replica

Test if nodes containing replicas will turn into primary or other nodes 
will be picked up for primary shard allocation

After node-data3 shutdown
get /_cat/shards/population?h=index,shard,prirep,dc,state,node

population 3 p 104 STARTED    data2
population 3 r     UNASSIGNED 
population 4 p 100 STARTED    master
population 4 r     UNASSIGNED 
population 1 p  89 STARTED    data2
population 1 r     UNASSIGNED 
population 2 r  87 STARTED    master
population 2 p  87 STARTED    data1
population 0 p  86 STARTED    master
population 0 r  86 STARTED    data1

master
shard 4 replica--now shows as primary
unassigned: shard 4 replica

data2
shard 1 replica--now shows as primary
unassigned:shard 1 replica

i.e. replica shards became primary

in few seconds we see the replicas are assigned to other available nodes
population 3 r 104 STARTED master
population 3 p 104 STARTED data2
population 4 p 100 STARTED master
population 4 r 100 STARTED data2
population 1 r  89 STARTED data1
population 1 p  89 STARTED data2
population 2 r  87 STARTED master
population 2 p  87 STARTED data1
population 0 p  86 STARTED master
population 0 r  86 STARTED data1
